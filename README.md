# Work Mode App

Work Mode App is a productivity app built using principles of design for neuordivergent workers. Users can create prioritized To-Do lists and use Pomodoro timers to stay focused.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, bcrypt, connect-mongo, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

Work Mode App uses MVC Architecture, it also implements "authorization" via Passport so folx can sign up, customize & personalize the app. I chose to use Bootstrap in order to simplify the design process of the app and Mongoose to simplify the database structure and access. EJS is leveraged in order to easily create the view files with the necessary Javascript.

## Optimizations

Next steps for this app would be to add optional alert sounds for the timer, have an ambient noise and/or spotify integration, and group tasks per deadline as well as priority. I would also want to create a better responsive outcome and implement ReactJS Hooks/Context.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I learned in this project was how to use MVC to abstract code in order to make it more readable, organized, and easier to edit. I also learned a lot about how font, colors, standardization of elements to reduce decision fatigue, and simplicity and reduction of clutter to reduce distraction all assist users with ADHD, Dyslexia, and a variety of other disabilities.
